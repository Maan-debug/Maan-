  <p>
    My favourite food is <strong>burger</strong>
    <!-- Type of font to write -->. 
    Yes, I do not know to make
    <em>burger by myself</em>.     <!-- Type of font -->
    But I can put the list of items for the recipe from google. 
    So, here is the list:-
  </p>    <!-- paragraph -->
  <ul>    <!-- unordered list -->
    <li>Sliced cheese</li>
    <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
    <li>Fresh red onions</li>
    <li>Tomato</li>
    <li>Green leaf or iceberg lettuce</li>
    <li>Avocado</li>
    <li>Bacon + pineapple + the BBQ sauce below
    Jalapeños to add some heat</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Steps to prepare burger:-</p>
  <ol><!-- ordered list -->
    <li>Prepare buns and toppings first and cook burger patties last.</li>
    <li>Use refrigerated Ground Chuck Beef (80/20)
      – grind your own or buy it ground, but 20% fat is ideal.</li>
    <li>Do not overwork your meat.</li>
    <li>Shape the patties 1” wider than the bun since they 
      shrink on the grill.</li>
    <li>Make an indentation in the center to prevent it 
      from plumping up in the center.</li>
    <li>Season patties generously with salt and pepper
      just prior to cooking. Salt changes the structure of proteins
      and toughens burgers. Do not salt the ground beef before forming
      into patties.</li>
    <li>Once on the grill, let patties brown and sear well 
      (3-5 min) before flipping and do not press down on the burger.</li>
  </ol>
